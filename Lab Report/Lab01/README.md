# Experiment No: 1
# Experiment Name: _Design of a 2-bit Logic unit._


## Introduction:
In this experiment you will construct a 2-bit logic unit which is actually a part of an ALU.
This logic unit will have 4 micro-operations which are AND, OR, XOR and NOT
operations. Logic micro operations are very useful for manipulating individual bits or a
portion of a word stored in a register. They can be used to change bit values, delete a
group of bits or insert a new set of bits in a register. As we are going to design a 2-bit
logic unit, we will have two outputs which is one output for each of the 2 bits.

## Equipments:
- Trainer board
- IC 7404,7408,7432,7486, 74F153
- Wires for connection.

## Procedure: (hardware):
1) Place the ICs on the trainer board.
2) Connect Vcc and ground to the respective pins of IC.
3) Connect the inputs with the switches and the outputs with LEDs.
4) Apply various combinations of inputs and observe the outputs.
5) Verify the experimental outputs with the Truth Table.

## Assignment/Task:
1. Implement the circuit in Logisim. Submit logisim (.circ) file + the screenshots of
the circuits within the given time by your lab instructor.
2. Prepare and submit the lab report by the end of the class individually. In the
report, you have to include the Screenshot of the circuit as a Circuit Diagram. The
screenshot must contain your name and ID along with the circuit.
> **Plagiarism and late submission will not be acceptable.
